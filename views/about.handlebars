        <span>Hi!</span>
        I'm
        <span class="name">Shi Shuang Yan</span>
        — a passionate learner in both
        <span>frontend</span>
        and
        <span>backend</span>
        development.
      </p>

        <p>
          I started building
          <span>My Library</span>
          to improve my web development skills and explore the creative side of
          programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          My current focus is mastering
          <span>Full Stack Development</span>
          — learning how the browser and server work together to create
          seamless, dynamic experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project reflects my growth in design, structure, and coding
          logic. Each page you visit is part of my journey to become a better
          developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe good design is not just about appearance, but about how
          things work — both visually and logically.
